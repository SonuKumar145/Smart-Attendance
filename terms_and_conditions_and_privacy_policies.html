                    The App is designed to help you conveniently manage and analyze your attendance records on your
                    mobile device. It operates without the need for a login system and saves your attendance data
                    locally on your device. This data is stored solely for analysis and reporting purposes within the
                    App. We do not store or transmit your data to external servers unless a crash or fatal error occurs,
